## Overview
This project contains files that load data in xls format and performs a principal component analysis (PCA) as well as visualize the data in various ways,
both before and after the PCA.

## Data
The data used is gathered by M. Koklu, Ilker Ali Ã–zkan as part of the paper 
"Multiclass classification of dry beans using computer vision and machine learning techniques", 2020, published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture.

The data and introductory paper can be found at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset.

## Figures
The figures produced by the code can be found in the subfolder "Figures" in png-format.

## Report

The report contains the sections:

1. Introduction
2. Description of the data set
3. Data visualization
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
